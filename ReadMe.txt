I used your old Makefile from previous projects so  you can just use that to run it.

make

./cgPP

once you get in you can use the mouse to select the animation you wanna see and the camera angle. Also switching the camera angle will stop the animation so just reclick the button and it will start back up from the position you left off in. Clicking an animation while already in one will cause it to return to idel and the start that new one. I did a lot of "Saturatoin testing" ie clicking a lot of stuff realy fast. So I don't think itll break easy.
